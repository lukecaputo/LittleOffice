    Lord, open my lips.

    Psalm 95
    A call to praise God
    
    Encourage each other daily while it is still today. (Hebrews 3:13)

    Ant. Come, let us worship Christ, the Son of Mary.

    Come, let us sing to the Lord
      and shout with joy to the Rock who saves us.
    Let us approach him with praise and thanksgiving
      and sing joyful songs to the Lord.

    The Lord is God, the mighty God,
      the great king over all the gods.
    He holds in his hands the depths of the earth
      and the highest mountains as well.
    He made the sea; it belongs to him,
      the dry land, too, for it was formed by his hands.

    Come, then, let us bow down and worship,
      bending the knee before the Lord, our maker.
    For he is our God and we are his people,
      the flock he shepherds.

    Today, listen to the voice of the Lord:
    Do not grow stubborn, as your fathers did
      in the wilderness,
    when at Meriba and Massah
      they challenged me and provoked me,
    Although they had seen all of my works.

    Forty years I endured that generation.
    I said, “They are a people whose hearts go astray
      and they do not know my ways.”
    So I swore in my anger,
      “They shall not enter into my rest.”

    Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:
    as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever. Amen.

    Ant. Come, let us worship Christ, the Son of Mary.


    MORNING PRAYER


    HYMN

    O Mary of all women,
    You are the chosen one,
    Who, ancient prophets promised,
    Would bear God’s only Son;
    All Hebrew generations
    Prepared the way to thee,
    That in your womb the God-man
    Might come to set us free.
    O Mary, you embody
    all God taught to our race,
    For you are first and foremost
    In fullness of His grace;
    We praise this wondrous honor
    That you gave birth to Him
    Who from you took humanity
    And saved us from our sin.

    Psalm 118
    Song of joy for salvation

    This Jesus is the stone which, rejected by you builders, has become the chief stone supporting all the rest. (Acts 4:11)

    Ant.1 The Virgin has given birth to the Savior: a flower has sprung from Jesse's stock and a star has risen from Jacob. O God, we praise you.

    Give thanks to the Lord for he is good,
    for his love endures forever.
    Let the sons of Israel say:
    "His love endures for ever."
    Let the sons of Aaron say:
    "His love endures for ever."
    Let those who fear the Lord say:
    "His love endures for ever."
    I called to the Lord in my distress;
    he answered and freed me.
    The Lord is at my side; I do not fear.
    what can man do against me?
    The Lord is at my side as my helper;
    I shall look down on my foes.
    It is better to take refuge in the Lord
    than to trust in men;
    it is better to take refuge in the Lord
    than to trust in princes.
    The nations all encompassed me;
    in the Lord's name I crushed them.
    They compassed me, compassed me about;
    in the Lord's name I crushed them.
    They compassed me about like bees;
    they blazed like a fire among thorns.
    In the Lord's name I crushed them.
    I was thrust down, thrust down and falling,
    but the Lord was my helper.
    The Lord is my strength and my song;
    he is my savior.
    There are shouts of joy and victory
    in the tents of the just.
    The Lord's right hand has triumphed;
    his right hand raised me.
    The Lord's right hand has triumphed;
    I shall not die, I shall live
    and recount his deeds.
    I was punished, I was punished by the Lord,
    but not doomed to die.
    Open to me the gates of holiness:
    I will enter and give thanks.
    This is the Lord's own gate
    where the just may enter.
    I will thank you for you have answered
    and you are my savior.
    The stone which the builders rejected
    has become the corner stone.
    This is the work of the Lord,
    a marvel in our eyes.
    This day was made by the Lord;
    we rejoice and are glad.
    O Lord, grant us salvation;
    O Lord, grant success.
    Blessed in the name of the Lord
    is he who comes.
    We bless you from the house of the Lord;
    the Lord God is our light.
    Go forward in procession with branches
    even to the altar.
    You are my God, I thank you.
    My God, I praise you.
    Give thanks to the Lord for he is good;
    for his love endures for ever.

    Canticle: Daniel 3:52-57
    Let all creatures praise the Lord.
    
    The Creator...is blessed for ever (Romans 1:25)

    Ant. 2 Mary has given birth to our Savior. John the Baptist saw him and cried out: This is the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world.

    Blessed are you, O Lord, the God of our fathers,
    praiseworthy and exalted above all forever;
    And blessed is your holy and glorious name,
    praiseworthy and exalted above all for all ages.
    Blessed are you in the temple of your holy glory,
    praiseworthy and glorious above all forever.
    Blessed are you on the throne of your kingdom,
    praiseworthy and exalted above all forever.
    Blessed are you who look into the depths
    from your throne upon the cherubim,
    praiseworthy and exalted above all forever.
    Blessed are you in the firmament of heaven,
    praiseworthy and glorious forever.
    Bless the Lord, all you works of the Lord,
    praise and exalt him above all forever.

    Psalm 150
    Praise the Lord
    
    Let mind and heart be in your song: this is to glorify God with your whole self (Hesychius)

    Ant. 3: Mary has given birth to a King whose name is everlasting; hers the joy of motherhood, hers the virgin's glory. Never was the like seen before, never shall it be seen again.
 
    Praise God in his holy place,
    praise him in his mighty heavens.
    Praise him for his powerful deeds,
    praise his surpassing greatness.
    O praise him with sound of trumpet,
    praise him with lute and harp.
    Praise him with timbrel and dance,
    praise him with strings and pipes.
    O praise him with resounding cymbals,
    praise him with clashing of cymbals.
    Let everything that lives and that breathes
    give praise to the Lord.

    Ant. 3: Mary has given birth to a King whose name is everlasting; hers the joy of motherhood, hers the virgin's glory. Never was the like seen before, never shall it be seen again.
 

    FIRST READING: Micah 5:2,3a,4a

    The ruler in Israel will give them up, until the time
      when she who is to give birth has borne,
    And the rest of his brethren shall return
      to the children of Israel.
    He shall stand firm and shepherd his flock
      by the strength of the Lord,
      in the majestic name of the Lord, his God;
    He shall be peace.


    SECOND READING: From a letter by Saint Athanasius, bishop (Epist. Ad Epictetum,5-9; PG 26,1058,1062-1066)
    The Word took our nature from Mary

    What was born of Mary was therefore human by nature, in accordance with the inspired Scriptures, and the body of the Lord was a true body: It was a true body because it was the same as ours. Mary, you see, is our sister, for we are all born from Adam.
    The words of St John, the Word was made flesh, bear the same meaning, as we may see from a similar turn of phrase in St Paul: Christ was made a curse for our sake. Mary's body has acquired something great through its communion and union with the Word. From being mortal it has been made immortal; though it was a living body it has become a spiritual one; though it was made from the earth it has passed through the gates of heaven.
    Even when the Word takes a body from Mary, the Trinity remains a Trinity, with neither increase nor decrease. It is for ever perfect. In the Trinity we acknowledge one Godhead, and thus one God, the Father of the Word, is proclaimed in the Church.
   

    RESPONSORY

    O Virgin Mary, no other daughter of Jerusalem is your equal,
    for you are the mother of the King of kings,
    you are the Queen of heaven and of angels.
     - Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb.

    Hail, full of grace; the Lord is with you.
     - Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb.


    CANTICLE OF ZECHARIAH: Luke 1:68-79
    The Messiah and his forerunner
    
    Ant. Marvelous is the mystery proclaimed today, human nature is made new as God becomes man; he remains what he was and becomes what he was not. Yet each nature stays distinct and becomes for ever undivided.

    Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel;
    he has come to his people and set them free.
 
    He has raised up for us a mighty savior,
    born of the house of his servant David.
 
    Through his holy prophets he promised of old,
      that he would save us from our enemies,
      from the hands of all who hate us.
 
    He promised to show mercy to our fathers
    and to remember his holy covenant.
 
    This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham,
    to set us free from the hands of our enemies,
    free to worship him without fear,
    holy and righteous in his sight
     all the days of our life.
 
    You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High,
    for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,
 
    To give his people knowledge of salvation
    by the forgiveness of their sins.
 
    In the tender compassion of our God
    the dawn from on high shall break upon us,
    to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death,
    and to guide our feet into the way of peace.
 
    Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:
    as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.  Amen.

    Our Father who art in Heaven, 
    Hallowed be thy name; 
    Thy kingdom come

    Psalm 112
    The happiness of the just man

    Live as children born of the light. Light produces every kind of goodness and justice and truth. (Ephesians 5:8-9).

    Ant. 2 By your miraculous birth from the virgin you have fulfilled the Scriptures: like a gentle rain falling upon the earth you have come down to save your people. O God, we praise you.

    Happy the man who fears the Lord,
    who take delight in all his commands.
    His sons shall be powerful on earth;
    the children of the upright are blessed.
    Riches and wealth are in his house;
    his justice stands firm for ever.
    He is a light in the darkness for the upright:
    he is generous, merciful and just.
    The good man takes pity and lends,
    he conducts his affairs with honor.
    The just man will never waver:
    he will be remembered for ever.
    He has no fear of evil news;
    with a firm heart he trusts in the Lord.
    With a steadfast heart he will not fear;
    he will see the downfall of his foes.
    Open-handed, he gives to the poor;
    his justice stands firm for ever.
    His head will be raised in glory.
    The wicked man sees and is angry,
    grinds his teeth and fades away;

    Christ suffered for you,
    and left you an example
    to have you follow in His footsteps.

    When He was insulted,
    He returned no insult.
    When He was made to suffer,
    He did not counter with threats.
    Instead He delivered Himself up
    to the One who judges justly.
    In His own body
    He brought your sins to the Cross,
    so that all of us, dead to sin,
    could live in accord with God's will.
    By His wounds you were healed.

    Ant. For our sakes God made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the holiness of God.


    FIRST READING: Galatians 4:4-5

    When the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to ransom those under the law, so that we might receive adoption.


    SECOND READING: From a sermon by Saint Sophronius, bishop (Oratio 2, in sanctissimae Deiparae Annuntiatione, 21-22, 26, PG 87, 3, 3242, 3250)
    Through Mary the Father's blessing has shone forth on humankind

    Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with you. What joy could surpass this, O Virgin Mother? What grace can excel that which God has granted to you alone? What could be imagined more dazzling or more delightful? Before the miracle we witness in you, all else pales; all else is inferior when compared with the grace you have been given. All else, even what is most desirable, must take second place and enjoy a lesser importance.
    The Lord is with you. Who would dare challenge you? You are God's mother; who would not immediately defer to you and be glad to accord you a greater primacy and honor? For this reason, when I look upon the privilege you have above all creatures, I extol you with the highest praise: Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with you. On your account joy has not only graced men, but is also granted to the powers of heaven.


    RESPONSORY

    My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord,
    my spirit rejoices in God my Savior;
    for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant.
    From this day all generations will call me blessed:
    the Almighty has done great things for me,
    and holy is his Name.
    He has mercy on those who fear him
    in every generation.
    He has shown the strength of his arm,
    he has scattered the proud in their conceit.
    He has cast down the mighty from their thrones,
    and has lifted up the lowly.
    He has filled the hungry with good things,
    and the rich he has sent away empty.
    He has come to the help of his servant Israel,
    for he has remembered his promise of mercy,
    The promise he made to our fathers,
    to Abraham and his children for ever.

    It is good to give thanks to the Lord,
    to make music to your name, O Most High,
    to proclaim your love in the morning
    and your truth in the watches of the night,
    on the ten-stringed lyre and the lute,
    with the murmuring sound of the harp.
    Your deeds, O Lord, have made me glad;
    for the work of your hands I shout with joy.
    O Lord, how great are your works!
    How deep are your designs!
    The foolish man cannot know this
    and the fool cannot understand.
    Though the wicked spring up like grass
    and all who do evil thrive,
    they are doomed to be eternally destroyed.
    But you, Lord, are eternally on high.
    See how your enemies perish;
    all doers of evil are scattered.
    To me you give the wild ox's strength;
    you anoint me with the purest oil.
    My eyes looked in triumph on my foes;
    my ears heard gladly of their fall.
    The just will flourish like the palm tree
    and grow like a Lebanon cedar.
    Planted in the house of the Lord
    they will flourish in the courts of our God,
    still bearing fruit when they are old,
    still full of sap, still green,
    to proclaim that the Lord is just.
    In him, my rock, there is no wrong.

    with glory and honor you crowned him,
    gave him power over the works of your hands,
    put all things under his feet.

    SECOND READING: From a letter by Paschasius Radbert, abbot (Letter Cogito me 20-23,26,28: PL 30, 122,42)
    Mary is taken from earth

    Today the glorious, ever-virgin Mary ascends to heaven. I urge you to rejoice, for, if I may so put it, she has been raised up in an ineffable way to be with Christ who reigns for ever. The Queen of the world is today taken from the earth and from this present evil time. I say again: rejoice, because she who is sure of her imperishable glory has reached the palace of heaven. 
    Exalt, I say, and rejoice, and let the whole world rejoice, because this day Salvation has drawn nearer for us all... 

    "Hail, Mary, full of grace; the Lord is with thee; blessed art thou amongst women." It was fitting that the Virgin should be given such gifts and be full of grace, since she has bestowed glory on heaven and has brought God and peace to the earth, faith to pagans, an end to vice, order to life, and discipline to morals. 
    And it was right that an angel be sent to the Virgin, because virginity always means kinship with the angels... 

    "Rejoice," the angel says, "for you are full of grace." Yes, full! for while a share of grace was given to others, the undiminished fullness of grace was poured into Mary.


    RESPONSORY

    The Virgin Mary was taken up to heaven.
        - The Virgin Mary was taken up to heaven.

    Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel; 
    he has come to his people and set them free.
 
    He has raised up for us a mighty savior, 
    born of the house of his servant David.
 
    Through his holy prophets he promised of old,
        that he would save us from our enemies,
        from the hands of all who hate us.
 
    He promised to show mercy to our fathers
    and to remember his holy covenant.
 
    This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham,
    to set us free from the hands of our enemies,
    free to worship him without fear,
    holy and righteous in his sight
        all the days of our life.
 
    You, my child, shall be called the prophet of the Most High,
    for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way,
 
    To give his people knowledge of salvation
    by the forgiveness of their sins.
 
    In the tender compassion of our God
    the dawn from on high shall break upon us,
    to shine on those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death,
    and to guide our feet into the way of peace.
 
    Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:
    as it was in the beginning, is now, and will be for ever.  Amen.

    INTERCESSIONS

        - Free us from the corruption of sin. 

    You are our redeemer, who made the immaculate Virgin Mary your purest home and the sanctuary of the Holy Spirit,
        - Make us temples of your Spirit for ever. 

    King of kings, you lifted up your mother, body and soul, into heaven, 
        - Help us to fix our thoughts on things above. 

    Lord of heaven and earth, you crowned Mary and set her at your right hand as queen,
        - Make us worthy to share this glory.


    Our Father who art in Heaven, 
    Hallowed be thy name; 
    Thy kingdom come 
    Thy will be done 
    On earth as it is in heaven. 
    Give us this day our daily bread; 
    And forgive us our trespasses 
    As we forgive those who trespass against us; 
    And lead us not into temptation, 
    But deliver us from evil.

    It is there that the tribes go up,

    Canticle: Philippians 2:6-11

    Ant 3: We share the fruit of life through you, O daughter blessed by the Lord.

    Christ, God's holy servant
    Though he was in the form of God,
    Jesus did not deem equality with God
    something to be grasped at.
    Rather, he emptied himself
    and took the form of a slave,
    being born in the likeness of men.
    He was known to be of human estate
    and it was thus that he humbled himself,
    obediently accepting even death,
    death on a cross!
    Because of this,
    God highly exalted him
    and bestowed on him the name
    above every other name,  
    So that at Jesus' name
    every knee must bend
    in the heavens, on the earth,
    and under the earth,
    and every tongue proclaim
    to the glory of God the Father:  
    JESUS CHRIST IS LORD!

    SECOND READING: From a homily on the falling asleep of the Blessed Virgin Mary by Saint Germanus of Constantinople, bishop (In Dormitionem B. Mariae I: PG 98, 345-348)
    The Assumption of Mary

    Truly, yes truly, and again I shall say in thanksgiving: even though you have left us, you have not deserted the Christian race. You who are like incorruptible life have not abandoned our mortal world, but on the contrary you draw near to those who call upon your name. You are found by those who faithfully seek you. And these visions indicate a living and continually active spirit and an everlasting body. For how could dissolution of the body return you to dust and ashes, you who delivered the human race from the destruction of death through the incarnation of your Son?
    Indeed you left our earth to prove that the mystery of the awe-inspiring incarnation was really fulfilled. The fact that you waited for the natural end of human life would convince the world that the God who was born of you came into being also as perfect man, the Son of a true Mother, who was subject to the laws and constraints of nature, by divine decree and the requirement of an earthly lifetime. As one who possessed a human body you could not escape death, the common fate of humanity.
    Thus even your Son, though God of all things, even he, through sharing, so to speak, the mortality of all our race, "tasted" a similar bodily "death." It was clearly in the same way as he made his own life-giving tomb that he made your sepulcher wonderful also, as the tomb of your falling asleep, a tomb which received life; therefore both tombs really received your bodies, but could in no way affect them with corruption. For nor could you, as the vessel which contained God, waste away to dust in the destruction of death.
    For since he who humbled himself in you was God from beginning and eternal life, so the Mother of Life was to share the dwelling of Life, to accept her death like a sleep and consent to her translation like a waking, as the Mother of Life. For just as a child seeks and longs for its own mother, and the mother loves to spend her time with her child, so it was right that you, with your maternal love for your Son and God, should return to him. And it was right too that God, preserving a Son's love for you, should make his companionship with you into a perpetual association.
    In this way, then, you suffered the death of finite beings and the translation to the immortal way of life of eternal beings where God dwells; and because you are his companion, Mother of God, you do not abandon your life with him.

     - Lord, make haste to help me.   

    Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:
    As it was in the beginning, is now, and will be forever. Amen.   


    HYMN

    Midmorning

    Breathe on me, breath of God,
    Fill me with life anew,
    That I may love the things you love,
    And do what you would do.
    Breathe on me, breath of God,
    Until my heart is pure,
    Until with you I have one will,
    To live and to endure.
    Breathe on me, breath of God,
    My soul with grace refine,
    Until this earthly part of me
    Glows with your fire divine.
    Breathe on me, breath of God,
    So I shall never die,
    But live with you the perfect life
    In your eternity.   


    Midday

    Help us, O Lord, to learn
    The truths thy Word imparts:
    To study that thy laws may be
    Inscribed upon our hearts.
    Help us, O Lord, to live
    The faith which we proclaim,
    That all our thoughts and words and deeds
    May glorify your name.
    Help us, O Lord, to teach
    The beauty of your ways,
    That yearning souls may find the Christ,
    And sing aloud his praise.    


    Midafternoon

    Firmly I believe and truly
    God is three and God is one;
    And I next acknowledge duly
    Manhood taken by the Son.
    And I trust and hope most fully
    In that manhood crucified;
    And I love supremely, solely
    Christ who for my sins has died.
    And I hold in veneration,
    For the love of him alone,
    Holy Church as his creation,
    And her teachings as his own.
    Praise and thanks be ever given
    With and through the angel host,
    To the God of earth and heaven,
    Father, Son and Holy Ghost.    


    PSALMODY
 
    Psalm 119:33-40

    Ant. 1 Lead me, Lord, in the path of your commandments.  

    Teach me the demands of your precepts
    And I will keep them to the end.
    Train me to observe your law,
    to keep it with my heart.
    Guide me in the path of your commands;
    for there is my delight.
    Bend my heart to your will
    and not to love of gain.  
    Keep my eyes from what is false:
    by your word, give me life.
    Keep the promise you have made
    to the servant who fears you.  
    Keep me from the scorn I dread,
    for your decrees are good.
    See, I long for your precepts:
    then in your justice, give me life.

    Ant. 1 Lead me, Lord, in the path of your commandments.  

 
    Psalm 34

    Ant.2 Those who seek the Lord will be filled with every blessing.  
                 
                    I.  
    I will bless the Lord at all times,
    his praise always on my lips;
    in the Lord my soul shall make its boast.
    The humble shall hear and be glad.
    Glorify the Lord with me.
    Together let us praise his name.
    I sought the Lord and he answered me;
    from all my terrors he set me free.
    Look towards him and be radiant;
    let your faces not be abashed.
    This poor man called; the Lord heard him
    and rescued him from all his distress.
    The angel of the Lord is encamped
    around those who revere him, to rescue them.
    Taste and see that the Lord is good.
    He is happy who seeks refuge in him.
    Revere the Lord, you his saints.
    They lack nothing, those who revere him.
    Strong lions suffer want and go hungry
    but those who seek the Lord lack no blessing.  
    
    Ant.2 Those who seek the Lord will be filled with every blessing.  

    
    Psalm 34

    Ant. 3 Seek and strive after peace.

                 II.
    Come, children, and hear me
    that I may teach you the fear of the Lord.
    Who is he who longs for life
    and many days, to enjoy his prosperity?
    Then keep your tongue from evil
    and your lips from seeking deceit.
    Turn aside from evil and do good;
    seek and strive after peace.
    The Lord turns his face against the wicked
    to destroy their remembrance from the earth.
    The Lord turns his eyes to the just
    and his ears to their appeal.
    They call and the Lord hears
    and rescues them in all their distress.
    The Lord is close to the broken-hearted;
    those whose spirit is crushed he will save.
    Many are the trials of the just man
    but from them all the Lord will rescue him.
    He will keep guard over all his bones,
    not one of his bones shall be broken.
    Evil brings death to the wicked;
    those who hate the good are doomed.
    The Lord ransoms the souls of his servants.
    Those who hide in him shall not be condemned.
   
    Ant. 3 Seek and strive after peace.


    Midmorning

    First Reading: Zephaniah 3:14-15

    Shout for joy, O daughter Zion!
      sing joyfully, 0 Israel!
    Be glad and exult with all your heart,
      O daughter Jerusalem!
    The King of Israel, the Lord,
      is in your midst.


    Second Reading: From a homily by St. Ambrose, bishop.
    Let Mary's soul be in each of you

    Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit after con­ceiving a son; Mary was filled before. “You are blessed,” said Elizabeth, “because you have believed.”
    You too are blessed because you have heard and be­lieved. The soul of every believer conceives and brings forth the Word of God and recognizes his works. Let Mary’s soul be in each of you to glorify the Lord. Let her spirit be in each of you to rejoice in the Lord. Christ has only one Mother in the flesh, but we all bring forth Christ by faith. Every soul free from contamination of sin and inviolate in its purity can receive the Word of God.
    Blessed are those who hear the word of God.
     - And cherish it in their hearts.    


    Midday

    First Reading: Zechariah 9:9

    Rejoice heartily, O daughter Zion,
      shout for joy, O daughter Jerusalem.
    See, your king shall come to you;
      a just savior is he.  


    Second Reading: From a homily by Saint Chrysologus, bishop
    Let no one judge in a human way what is done is a divine mystery
    
    A virgin conceived and a virgin brought forth her child. Do not be disturbed at this conception or confused when you hear of this birth. Let no one judge in a human way what is done in a divine mystery. Let no one try to penetrate this heavenly mystery by earthly reasoning. Let no one treat this novel secret from knowledge of everyday occurrences. Let no one manipulate the work of love into an insult, or run the risk of losing faith.
    Blessed is the womb of the Virgin Mary.
     - Who bore the Son of the Eternal Father.  


    Midafternoon

    First Reading: Judith 13:31

    Blessed are you in every tent of Judah; and in every foreign nation, all who hear of you will be struck with terror.    
    
    
    Second Reading: From a homily by an unknown Greek author
    Mary is celebrated in the sacred words of Scripture
    
    Mary stood at your right hand, robed in a gown of gold, with adornment intricately wrought. Just as, being a woman, she was named queen and lady and Mother of God, so also now, standing as queen at the right hand of her most regal Son, she is celebrated in the sacred words of Scripture as clothed in the golden gown of incorruptibility. And so as we gaze upon him who is our king and lord and God, and upon her who is queen and lady and the Mother of God, contemplating them with the clear-sighted eye of our minds, let us repeat again and again unceasingly: The queen stands at your right hand, robed in a gown of gold with adornment intricately wrought.
    Blessed are you among women.
     - And blessed is the fruit of your womb.    
  

    Concluding Prayer

    Lord, make the peace we pray for a reality: may we live our days in quiet joy and, with the help of the Virgin Mary’s prayers, safely reach your kingdom.
    Grant this through Christ our Lord.
    - Amen

    Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:

    CONFESSION
    A brief examination of conscience should be made at this point. At its conclusion a penitential prayers may be said.
   
    I confess to almighty God,
    and to you, my brothers and sisters,
    that I have sinned through my own fault
    in my thoughts and in my words,
    in what I have done,
    and in what I have failed to do;
    and I ask blessed Mary, ever virgin,
    all the angels and saints,
    and you, my brothers and sisters,
    to pray for me to the Lord our God.
  

    HYMN

    O Christ, you are the light and day
    Which drives away the night,
    The ever shining Sun of God
    And pledge of future light.
    As now the evening shadows fall
    Please grant us, Lord, we pray,
    A quiet night to rest in you
    Until the break of day.
    Remember us, poor mortal men,
    We humbly ask, O Lord,
    And may your presence in our souls
    Be now our great reward.   


    PSALMODY
 
    Psalm 91

    Antiphon. Night holds no terrors for me sleeping under God’s wings.  

    He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High
    and abides in the shade of the Almighty
    says to the Lord: “My refuge,
    my stronghold, my God in whom I trust!”
    It is he who will free you from the snare
    of the fowler who seeks to destroy you;
    he will conceal you with his pinions
    and under his wings you will find refuge.
    You will not fear the terror of the night
    nor the arrow that flies by day,
    nor the plague that prowls in the darkness
    nor the scourge that lays waste at noon.
    A thousand may fall at your side,
    ten thousand fall at your right,
    you, it will never approach;
    his faithfulness is buckler and shield.
    Your eyes have only to look
    to see how the wicked are repaid,
    you who have said: “Lord, my refuge!”
    and have made the Most High your dwelling.
    Upon you no evil shall fall,
    no plague approach where you dwell.
    For you has he commanded his angels,
    to keep you in all your ways.
    They shall bear you upon their hands
    lest you strike your foot against a stone.
    On the lion and the viper you will tread
    and trample the young lion and the dragon.
    Since he clings to me in love, I will free him;
    protect him for he knows my name.
    When he calls I shall answer: “I am with you.”
    I will save him in distress and give him glory.
    With length of life I will content him;
    I shall let him see my saving power.

    Antiphon. Night holds no terrors for me sleeping under God’s wings.  


    First Reading: Revelation 22:4-5

    They will look upon his face, and his name will be on their foreheads. Night will be no more, nor will they need light from lamp or sun, for the Lord God shall give them light, and they shall reign forever and ever.    


    Second Reading: From a homily by St. Bede the Venerable, priest. (Lib. 1-4; CCL 122, 25-26, 30)
    Remembering the example of God's Mother

    By meditating upon the incarnation, our devotion is kindled, and by remembering the example of God’s Mother, we are encouraged to lead a life of virtue. Such virtues are best achieved in the evening. We are weary after the day’s work and worn out by our distractions. The time for rest is near, and our minds are ready for contemplation.     


    RESPONSORY

    Into  your hands, Lord, I commend my spirit.
     - Into your hands, Lord, I commend my spirit.  

    Your have redeemed us, Lord God of truth.
     - I commend my spirit.   

    Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:
    - Into your hands, Lord, I commend my spirit.      
    

    NUNC DIMITTIS Canticle of Simeon: Luke 2:29-32

    Ant. Protect us, Lord, as we stay awake; watch over us as we sleep, that awake, we may keep watch with Christ, and asleep, rest in his peace.   

    Lord, now you let your servant go in peace;
    your word has been fulfilled:
    My own eyes have seen the salvation
    which you have prepared in the sight of every people:
    a light to reveal you to the nations
    and the glory of your people Israel.

    Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit:
    As it was in the beginning, is now, and will be forever. Amen.   
    
    Ant. Protect us, Lord, as we stay awake; watch over us as we sleep, that awake, we may keep watch with Christ, and asleep, rest in his peace.   


    PRAYER

    Father of holiness,
    for the journey of your pilgrim Church on earth,
    you have provided the Virgin Mary as a sign and beacon.
    Through her intercession
    sustain our faith and enliven our hope,
    that no obstacle may divert us
    from the road which brings us to salvation.
    Grant this through Christ our Lord.   


    BLESSING

    May the all-powerful Lord grant us a restful night and a peaceful death.
    - Amen.
